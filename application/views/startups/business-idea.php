 <p>Start-up activity in India is attracting a lot of attention. And why not?

<h5>Developing a Business Plan</h5>
 

<p> 
A business plan is the formal written expression of the entrepreneurial vision, describing the strategy and operations of the proposed venture and the advantages of writing a business plan far outweigh the costs. The purpose of the plan is to enable the top executives of the firm to think about their business in a comprehensive way, to communicate their objectives to individuals who may have a stake in the firm\'s future, to have a basis for making decisions, and to facilitate the planning process<br/>
 
A simple startup plan includes a summary, mission statement, keys to success, market analysis and break-even analysis. This kind of plan is good for deciding whether or not to proceed with a plan, to tell if there is a business worth pursuing, but it is not enough to run a business with<br/>
 
Simply put, not every business needs the full formal plan, but every business needs a plan. Think through and write down your core strategy, assumptions, review schedule, dates, deadlines, task responsibilities, and basic business numbers. Those basic business numbers are the sales forecast, expense forecast including personnel, startup costs, and startup funding.
 
Failure to plan is a plan for failure. The business plan document does not need to be complex or convoluted, but it is necessary. If you are having a hard time pulling your plan together, our experts at BusinessDeals will extend their assistance in this area.
